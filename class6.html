	Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
	And soory I could not travel both<br>
	And be onne traveller, long I stood<br>
	And looked down one as far as I could<br>
	To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br><br>
	Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
	And having perhaps the better clain,<br>
	Because it is grassy and wanted wear;<br>
	Though as for that the passing there<br>
	Had worn them really about the same,<br>
	<!--line with break-->
	<p>
		And both that morning equally lay<hr>
		In leaves no step had trodden black

	'The starlight Night' was
